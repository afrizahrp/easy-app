A **real-time sales dashboard** built with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** to streamline sales reporting for multiple companies. This project enables businesses to monitor sales performance, track key metrics, and generate insights across different tenants in a single, user-friendly interface.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Multi-Company Sales Dashboard was developed to address the challenge of **inefficient sales reporting** for businesses managing multiple entities. By leveraging **Next.js** and a **multi-tenant architecture**, this dashboard provides:

- **Real-time analytics**: Visualize sales data with dynamic charts.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple companies with isolated data.
- **Responsive design**: Seamless experience on desktop and mobile.
- **Scalable foundation**: Ready for integration with backend APIs (e.g., Node.js, Golang).

This project showcases my skills in **full-stack development** and my passion for solving real-world business problems.
